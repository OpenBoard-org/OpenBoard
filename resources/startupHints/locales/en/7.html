		One of the simplest but really useful features of OpenBoard is screen capture. With it, you can create a snapshot of any particular state of the Board, during your class session.
		<h3>In Board Mode</h3>
		<p>Search for<span class="icon"><img src="../../assets/common/captureAreaBoard.png" alt="the screen capture icon"></span> in the Stylus palette, click on it and select the area to capture. Then, you'll have three options : </p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Add to current page</b></li>
			<li><b>Add in a new page</b></li>
			<li><b>Add to library</b>(adds the capture to the Pictures folder, so you can reuse it at any time)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here's an example of the whole process : </p>
		<div class="image"><img src="../../assets/hint7/gif-capture1.gif" alt=""></div>
		
		<span class="tip"><span class="icon"><img src="../../assets/common/tip.png" alt=""></span>You don't have to worry about the Stylus palette, the Board's thumbnails view or the OpenBoard Library, they won't be captured by your lasso !</span>

		<h3>In Desktop Mode</h3>
		<p>You can do the same thing in Desktop Mode, to capture your work on other softwares. Go to Desktop Mode by clicking on <span class="icon"><img src="../../assets/common/display.png" alt=""></span></p>
		<p>You'll find two icons : <span class="icon"><img src="../../assets/common/captureScreen.png" alt=""></span> to capture the whole screen, and <span class="icon"><img src="../../assets/common/captureAreaDesktop.png" alt=""></span> to capture just a part of it. Like in Board Mode, you'll have to choose where to drop the capture you made</p>
		
		<p>Here's an illustration of the whole process</p>
		<div class="image"><img src="../../assets/hint7/capture-gif2.gif" alt=""></div>


		<h3>In Web Mode</h3>
		<p>Again, the same process is available in Web Mode, where you will be able to capture just a part of the screen, or capture the current tab with <span class="icon"><img src="../../assets/common/captureWindow.png" alt=""></span></p>
