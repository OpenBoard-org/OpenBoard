		<p>You'll also find in this mode two very important features : Import and Export.</p>
		<div class="image"><img id="importation1" src="assets/hint5/img1.png" alt=""></div>

		<h3>Import</h3>
		<p>You can import PDF files (<span class="file-extension">.pdf</span>), images (<span class="file-extension">.png</span>, <span class="file-extension">.jpg</span>), OpenBoard documents (<span class="file-extension">.ubz</span>) or OpenBoard folders (<span class="file-extension">.ubx</span>), by clicking on <span class="icon"><img src="assets/common/import.png" alt=""></span></p>
		<div class="image"><img src="assets/hint5/gif1.gif" alt=""></div>
		<p>Note that you can also import an OpenBoard document (<span class="file-extension">.ubz</span>) by double-clicking on it. It will launch OpenBoard if not already launched, and import it (or ask for replacement if it already exists).</p>
		<span class="tip"><span class="icon"><img src="assets/common/tip.png" alt=""></span>You can also import multiple elements at a time, without having to click on <span class="icon"><img src="assets/common/import.png" alt=""></span> again and again.</span>
		<h3>Export</h3>
		<p>You can export an OpenBoard document to PDF or UBZ, and an OpenBoard folder to UBX. Thus, you can, for example :
			<ul>
				<li>Save the work done during a class session and share it with a missing student</li>
				<li>Share it with other teachers, or store it on an USB device and open it on another computer</li>
				<li>Import a student's homework in the PDF format, annotate it, and export the annotated PDF to send it back to the student</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<div class="image"><img src="assets/hint5/gif2.gif" alt=""></div>
		
		<span class="tip"><span class="icon"><img src="assets/common/tip.png" alt=""></span>Export all your documents by selecting the "My documents" folder before clicking on the export button, to export it as a UBX file, and then import it on another computer. It's also a good way to make a backup of your work !</span>
