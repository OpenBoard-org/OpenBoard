0.2 (95-dec-12)
---------------
First public release.


0.3 (96-jan-13)
---------------
LZW patent workaround.
Implemented inline images.
Fixed (mostly) disjoint polygon fills.
Added remote server stuff.
Added page number on command line.
Fixed problem with font encodings which caused character misalignment.
Fixed inverted CCITT decoding and inverted image mask drawing.
Now compiles under gcc 2.7.x (ignore those stupid 'unused parameter'
  warnings).
Many minor bug fixes and optimizations.


0.4 (96-apr-24)
---------------
Implemented DCT filter.
Implemented PostScript output; wrote pdftops program.
Implemented links.
Implemented font rotation -- I was wrong: X11R6 servers *do* support
  font rotation (by specifying a matrix in place of a size).
Added bindings for Home/End, Page Up/Down, arrow keys.
Added initialZoom resource and -z option.
Added geometry resource and -g option.
Fixed image size off-by-one bug.
Fixed bug where page content is reference to an array of streams.
Cleaned up uninitialized variables which were causing random problems
  on various platforms.
Manually skip whitespace before calling atoi() for startxref.
Replaced calls to XrmCombineFileDatabase() with calls to
  XrmGetFileDatabase() and XrmMergeDatabases() so it will work under
  older versions of X.
Fixed problem with reading multiple xref tables in updated PDF files.
Check for encryption and print appropriate error message.
Rudimentary dithering of images.
Fixed bug in CCITTFax filter (pass mode followed by horizontal mode).
Optimized drawImage() and drawImageMask().
Changed several things to ease porting:
  - changed '__inline' to 'inline' (to adhere to the ANSI standard)
  - surrounded interface/implementation pragmas with #ifdef _GNUC__
  - got rid of empty array initializer lists
  - moved Operator type definition from Gfx.cc to Gfx.h
  - renamed String, uint, etc.
  - ability to uncompress to file (NO_POPEN and USE_GZIP flags)
  - added definitions of XK_Page_Up/Down and XPointer for old versions
    of X
For VMS port:
  - use correct Xdefaults name for VMS, get rid of ltkGetHomeDir()
  - added '#include <stddef.h>' before all X includes
  - renamed files with multiple periods in their names
Fixed window resizing infinite oscillation bug.
Fixed problem with string-type (as opposed to stream-type) indexed
  color space lookup tables (which are used in inline images).
If an X font is not found, try smaller and then larger sizes (this is
  useful for old or broken X servers which can't scale bitmap fonts).
Added -rgb (color cube size) option.
Various minor bug fixes.


0.5 (96-may-23)
---------------
Fixed bug in LTKWindow which broke the remote server mode.
Fixed PostScript output:
  - doesn't seg fault if file is unwritable.
  - incorrect DSC comment - need colon in '%%Page:'.
  - use 'imagemask' command for masks.
  - output filters in the correct order.
  - Stream::isBinary() checks the next-to-bottom, not top, stream.
  - if page width > height, rotate it 90 degrees.
  - if page is larger than paper size, scale it down.
Set default MediaBox to 8.5" x 11" to deal with non-compliant PDF
  files which don't specify a MediaBox.
Added DEBUG_MEM stuff in gmem.c and gmempp.cc.
Fixed memory leaks:
  - LTKWindow didn't delete the LTKBox.
  - LinkAction needs a virtual destructor.
Use $(RANLIB) variable in goo/Makefile and ltk/Makefile.
Allocate image data after calling XCreateImage, using
  image->bytes_per_line -- works in 24-bit mode now.
DCTStream rounds width of rowBuf lines up to the next multiple of
  mcuWidth, so last MCU doesn't run off end of buffer.
Increase size of block (from 255 to 1024 bytes) read at end of file to
  search for 'startxref'.
Skip past garbage at start of file, look for '%PDF'.
Moved more compiler options out of Makefiles into Makefile.config.
Top-level Makefile uses '$(MAKE)' instead of 'make' for making
  subdirectories.
Space/PageDown/Next and Backspace/PageUp/Previous now moves to
  next/previous page if already scrolled to bottom/top of current
  page.


0.5a (96-jul-09)
----------------
[not a public release]
For PDF 1.2 (a.k.a. Amber, a.k.a. Acrobat 3) support:
  - look for trailer after first xref instead of at end of file.
Deal with font subsets by converting character names of the form
  'Cnnnn' to the appropriate character from the standard encoding.
Extract encoding from embedded Type 1 fonts.
Kludge to fill one-pixel thick polygons.
Changed X font encoding to use endash for hyphen (gets rid of too-long
  hyphens).
Handle Resources key in Pages dictionaries (needed for pstoedit
  output).
Fix comment handling in Parser (needed for pstoedit output).
Move Bezier curve conversion from GfxState to XOutputDev; look at
  flatness parameter in GfxState.
Change all of the path functions in XOutputDev (stroke, fill, clip) to
  use the same path transformation/conversion function.
Rewrote PostScript output driver as a subclass of OutputDev; removed
  duplicated code (ps_ functions) from Gfx.
Fixed bug in xref code with small (< 1024 bytes) PDF files.
Implemented BX/EX operators.
Added PDFDoc class.


0.6 (96-nov-12)
---------------
Add support for PostScript output to stdout (-) and to a command
  (|lpr); added -ps option and psFile resource.
Decryption is implemented but not included in the distribution due to
  legal restrictions: the decryption algorithm is a trade secret of
  RSA, Inc., and the U.S.A. still has bogus export controls on
  cryptography software.
Added .xpdfrc config file:
  - Added fontmap parameter: user can map PDF font names to X fonts.
  - Added fontpath parameter: search for Type 1 font if encoding is
    not in PDF file.
Incremental display: display is updated after every 200 commands.
Added forward and backward by-10-page buttons.
Links:
  - Implement links with "Launch" actions that point to PDF files.
  - Draw borders around links.
  - Handle links with named destinations.
  - GoToR links specify a page number instead of a page reference.
Optimizations:
  - Rewrote Stream to use buffering, and added lookChar() functions;
    rewrote Lexer to take advantage of this.
  - Use hash tables for name->code mapping in font encodings.
  - Made XOutputDev::doCurve() iterative, changed /2 to *0.5, and
    changed the flatness test.
Added file name to window title.
Implemented RunLength filter.
Implemented forms.
Convert ObjType to an enum.
Changed isDict("Pages") to isDict() (in Catalog.cc) to deal with
  incorrect PDF files.
Changed color selection so that very pale colors don't map to white.
Fixed bug in CCITTFax filter (multiple make-up codes).
In GString::clear(): need to set length to 0 before calling resize().
Base initial window size on first displayed page, not page 1; deal
  correctly with rotated pages.
Added ltkGetIntResource() and LTKApp::getIntResource().
PostScript output fixes:
  - Escape backslashes in strings.
  - When doing ASCII85 encoding, keep both chars of EOF marker ('~>')
    on same line.
  - Add extra line '%-EOD-' after image data streams; call wrapper
    functions for image and imagemask which look for this line -- this
    should fix the 'too much data in stream' bug.
  - Font tags can be reused for different fonts on different pages --
    so use font object reference (number/generation) instead.
Initialize character widths to zero (this caused crashes on OSF/1).
Handle image masks which go outside of pixmap.
Makefile.config changes:
  - Remove -o in C++ compile rule.
  - Add $(AR) variable.
Code which read char widths from font dictionary read all but the last
  width.
Add 'return 0;' to main() in xpdf and pdftops.
Allow fonts to use StandardEncoding.
Convert man pages to VMS help files.

0.7 (97-may-28)
---------------
Implemented FlateDecode filter (for PDF 1.2).
Basic xref table reconstruction for damaged files
New pdftotext program converts PDF to plain text.
Implemented menus in LTK; added a menu to xpdf.
Added open and save functions; allow xpdf to start without any PDF
  file.
Implemented text find.
Implemented text select/copy.
Change mouse cursor when it's over a link.
Embed Type 1 fonts in PostScript output.
Moved rotate functions to menu; added quit to menu.
Fixed stroke color bug in PostScript output (was using fill color
  instead of stroke color; this sometimes caused lines to be missing
  (white) in PostScript output).
Support Launch-type links -- pops up a dialog before executing
  anything.  Expects the A (action) dictionary to contain a Unix
  dictionary with F (file) and P (paremeter) keys just like the Win
  dictionary.
A moveto op all by itself should just be discarded, instead of
  generating a subpath with one point (this was causing seg faults).
Balanced parentheses in strings don't need to be escaped.
Tj operator in PostScript prolog didn't check for zero when dividing
  by length of string.
Implemented selection in LTK; TextIn widgets support dragging/copy/
  paste.
Handle font subsets that use hex character codes.
Added icon pixmap; added the XPMLIB and NO_XPM variables to
  Makefile.config.
Fixed subtle bug in use of horizontal scaling parameter (it affects
  only the width of drawn characters, not positioning done in text
  space).
Memory testing (with DEBUG_MEM):
  - gmalloc now fills memory blocks with garbage to catch unitialized
    fields.
  - gfree fills memory blocks with garbage to catch uses of freed
    blocks.
Handle image masks which go off the pixmap on the top and/or left.
Fixed inline functions which had two return statements (to make the
  HP, SCO, and other cfront-based compilers happy).
Fixed bug which caused seg faults when following a link to a different
  file (info in LinkGoto object was used after link was deleted by
  loadFile).
If page content is an array of streams, the streams are concatenated;
  objects and commands can span multiple streams.
If file open fails, try lower-casing and upper-casing the file name.
Commands should end when lexer sees a '/' character.
GString::append(char *, int) was broken.
Changed LTKScrollingCanvas redraw to be more efficient: copy as much
  as possible from window before copying from off-screen pixmap.
Ignore gs (set extended graphics state) operator.
Handle colorspaces (CalGray/RGB are treated as DeviceGray/RGB; the
  weird colorspaces are not yet implemented).
Named destinations (for links) can be strings as well as names; deal
  with the names tree in the catalog.
Clip to the page CropBox.
Added '-q' to gzip options (to suppress warnings, in case user has -v
  in GZIP env var).
Added 'include Makefile.config' to top-level Makefile.
Added INSTALL variable to Makefile.config; used in top-level
  Makefile.
Always initialize LinkDest left/bottom/top/right/zoom fields (bogus
  floating point values were causing crashes on Alpha).
Added Makefile.config options for Digital Unix (DEC compilers), HP-UX
  (HP compilers), SCO Unix, and Evans & Sutherland ES/OS.
Added flag to set stream mode in fopen call for VMS.
Rewrote Link module.
Pages with no contents shouldn't cause an error message.
In PostScript output: pdfImM needs to set fill color before doing
  imagemask.
If font doesn't specify character widths, use widths from built-in
  font, based on font flags.
Fixed LTK scrollbar to delay before repeating and to control the
  period between repeats.
Removed window/widget copy() methods (they were untested and unused).
Unknown filter types produce a single error message instead of a
  stream of errors.
Added a dummy target in top-level Makefile so making individual
  executables (e.g., 'make pdftops') should now work.
Added optional xpdf-flip.ltk with buttons on right side instead of
  bottom of window.

0.7a (98-feb-22)
----------------
Moved find command from menu to toolbar button ('f' key still works).
Support TrueColor visuals.
Added a -cmap option and a installCmap resource to install a private
  colormap.
Mouse button 2 pans the window.
Selecting a URI link now executes a configurable command (from the
  urlCommand resource).
Added a "link info" display which shows the URL or file for the link
  under the mouse.
Don't draw (or convert to PostScript) text drawn in render modes 3 and
  7 -- this is invisible text, used by Acrobat Capture; this text is
  still passed to the TextPage object so that selection works.
Recognize (and quietly ignore) marked content operators (BMC, BDC,
  EMC, MP, DP).
Recognize new color-setting operators (scn, SCN).
Added A4_PAPER option.
Embed external Type 1 font files (this currently only works with PFA
  files).
Added "-level1" option (in xpdf and pdftops) to generate Level 1
  PostScript.
Setup autoconf -- replaced Makefile.config.  Added SELECT_TAKES_INT
  flag, and use configure to autodetect (for HP-UX).
Fixed appendToPath() to behave reasonably when appending ".." to root
  directory.
Fixed array size in FlateStream::compHuffmanCodes() (was causing xpdf
  to crash under OSF/1).
ASCII85Stream, ASCIIHexStream, and DCTStream didn't check for EOF and
  could run past the end of the stream in damaged files.
Handle hex escapes (#xx) in names.  Still allow the name /# for
  backward-compatibility.
Check for NULL characters in encoding array in GfxFont.cc (was calling
  strcmp() with NULL which crashed under Solaris).
PageAttrs::PageAttrs() didn't initialize crop box boundaries.
Changed uses of lookup() to lookupNF() in XRef.cc.
Fixed type checking of operators which take a variable number of
  args.
Gfx::buildImageStream() doesn't need to check for parser (since I got
  rid of the bogus array-of-command thing).
XOutputFont matches on font reference instead of font tag (similar to
  PSOutputDev fix).
Fixed bug in position calculation for multi-char substitutions in
  XOutputDev.
Cleaned up local variables which hid class variables.
Optimized variable length decoding in CCITTFaxStream.
Set link border width to zero if Border dictionary entry is missing.
Throw away zero-length strings in TextOutputDev -- they don't have
  valid xMin/xMax values.
Swapped order of XLIBS and XPMLIB in xpdf/Makefile.
Deleted 'LTKApp::' in function declaration in LTKApp.h.
Changed '(XKeyEvent *)&event' to '&event.xkey' in LTKApp.cc.
Check that the link rectangle coordinates are in the correct order,
  and swap if necessary.
TextOutputDev didn't set text to NULL, which caused pdftotext to
  segfault if it couldn't open it's output file.
Fixed a hash table search bug in GfxFontEncoding::getCharCode().
Cleaned up colorspace code: rewrote GfxColorSpace and added
  GfxImageColorMap; cleaned up PSOutputDev::doImage.
Handle named colorspaces in images.
Correctly set the default color after a colorspace change.
Old setcolor operators now set the colorspace.
Fixed bug with uncompressed blocks in FlateStream.
Fixed bug with fixed Huffman code table in FlateStream.
Added hash table of X windows (for LTKWindow and LTKWidget) to LTKApp
  and replaced calls to XQueryTree with hash table searches -- this
  avoids a roundtrip to the server for each event and also fixes the
  problem where XQueryTree crashed if the window no longer existed
  (with leftover events from a destroyed window).  (Thanks to Yair
  Lenga for the suggestion.)
Create a new GC for selection -- xor black and white (instead of LTK
  foreground and background).
Fixed crash with blank lines in .xpdfrc.
Allow spaces in font descriptors in fontmap lines in .xpdfrc.
Check for bogus object number in XRef::fetch().
Use MacRomanEncoding for TrueType fonts that don't specify an
  encoding.
Certain PDF generators apparently don't include FontDescriptors for
  Arial, TimesNewRoman, and CourierNew -- set GfxFont flags
  appropriately.
Fixed a bug in width guessing in GfxFont -- sans serif and serif were
  swapped.
Rewrote XRef::readXRef() to avoid using a parser to read the xref
  entries.
Added NO_TEXT_SELECT option.
Ignore APPn/COM/etc. markers in DCT streams.
Replaced select() with XMultiplexInput() in LTKApp.cc for VMS.
Handle WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol -- if you ask the window manager to
  delete the xpdf window, xpdf will exit cleanly; other
  windows/dialogs are simply closed.
Optimized DCT decoder; switched to integer arithmetic.
The "/Type /Annots" field in an annotation dictionary is optional.
Check for null nameTree in Catalog::findDest().
In XOutputDev, search user font map before default font map.
Added "normal" SETWIDTH parameter to all font descriptors in
  XOutputDev (some systems have a narrow-width Helvetica font).
Added FOPEN_READ_BIN and FOPEN_WRITE_BIN to support Win32.
Added a hack which allows better font substitution for some Type 3
  fonts.  Also allow character names of the form /nn and /nnn.
Added <strings.h> and <bstring.h> to LTKApp.cc (needed by AIX and IRIX
  for bzero() declaration for FD_ZERO).

0.80 (98-nov-27)
----------------
Support for some Japanese fonts (Type 0 fonts using the Adobe-Japan1-2
  character collection, horizontal only).
Added pdfinfo application.
Added pdftopbm application.
Added pdfimages application.
Added -papercolor option and .paperColor resource.
Fixed divide-by-zero problem in XOutputDev Type 3 font matrix kludge.
Font subset char names can be 'Bxx' as well as 'Cxx' and 'Gxx'.
Fixed bug in color space conversion in DCTStream filter (YCC->RGB was
  correct, YCCK->CMYK was broken).
Added XRef::getDocInfo() and PDFDoc::getDocInfo() to support pdfinfo.
Optimized GfxImageColorMap.
Lexer::getStream(), getPos(), and setPos() check for null stream.
Decryption code now does strings as well as streams.
ASCII85 decoder rounds short tuples up instead of down.
CropBox and MediaBox can be non-integers.
PostScript output:
  - Use a rectangle operator.
  - Call setpagedevice with page size.
  - Insert %%PageOrientation comments.
  - Add paper size flags (-paperw and -paperh) to xpdf and pdftops.
  - If HAVE_POPEN is not defined, and user tries to print to '|...',
    the PSOutputDev destructor tried to write to the PS file.
  - Added support for forms (pdftops -form).
Removed error messages for empty paths in stroke, fill, etc. operators.
Don't allow flatnesses less than 1 in XOutputDev (this speeds up
  rendering a little bit when there are lots of tiny curves).
Moved the font subset character name guessing from GfxFont to
  XOutputDev and TextOutputDev - now these files print correctly.
Cast argument to XFree() to XPointer; add XPointer definition where
  necessary (portability fixes).
Various minor VMS fixes.
Changes to configure script and Makefiles:
  - Print a warning if X is missing.
  - Use C++ when checking select() argument type (HP-UX).
  - Use 0 instead of NULL when checking select().
  - Default to gcc instead of c++.
  - Get rid of AC_C_INLINE -- this is meant for C, not C++.
  - Changed -USE_GZIP to -DUSE_GZIP.
  - Added ability to compile ouside of the source tree.
  - Added .cc.o rule to {goo,ltk,xpdf}/Makefile.in.
  - Added @LIBS@ to XLIBS in xpdf/Makefile.in.
  - In top-level Makefile.in: added '-' to clean commands; added
    distclean rule.
  - Create install directories.
  - Use INSTALL_DATA (instead of INSTALL) for man pages.
  - Changed xpdf-ltk.h rule to avoid leaving an empty file when
    ltkbuild fails.
  - Change things so that by default, ltkbuild is not built and
    xpdf-ltk.h is not rebuilt.
  - Use AM_PROG_CC_STDC to add compiler flags for ANSI C.
  - Modify autoconf's builtin macros to check for xlC.
  - Use Steve Robbins' smr_CHECK_LIB to test for pixmap library (Xpm)
    -- this should fix the problems on systems that have the library
    but not the include file.
  - Added better test for sys/select.h, sys/bsdtypes.h, strings.h,
    bstring.h.
  - New VMS make scripts from Martin P.J. Zinser.
  - Moved dependences into Makefile.in -- this gets rid of problems
    with 'cc -MM' (which is gcc-specific) and 'include Makefile.dep'
    (which isn't supported by all make implementations).  Also changed
    all non-system include files to '#include "..."' (from '<...>').
Tweaked the TextOutputDev heuristics slightly.
Modify Gfx to use a stack of resources -- this is necessary for Form
  XObjects, which can define their own local resources; also modified
  PSOutputDev to dump fonts used by forms.
Look for excessively large MediaBox (compared to CropBox) and shrink
  it to CropBox.
Minor fix to scrolling when dragging a selection.
Various patches for pdftex and Win32 support.
Deal with Separation colorspaces by using their alternate colorspace

Added support for 1-D and mixed 1-D/2-D (Group 3) decoding to
  CCITTDecode filter.
Added resetImage(), getImagePixel(), and skipImageLine() to Stream
  class; used these in XOutputDev, PSOutputDev, and ImageOutputDev.
Implemented predictor for LZW and Flate filters.
In pdfImM1 in PSOutputDev prolog: div should be idiv.
Changed output from printUsage() function in parseargs to look nicer.

Type 1C fonts are converted to Type 1 and embedded in PostScript.
Support vertical Japanese text.
Added Japanese text support (EUC-JP) to pdftotext.
Bumped PDF version to 1.3.  Added stub functions for ri and sh
  operators. (But there are still some missing 1.3 features.)
Added -raw option to pdftotext.

Top-level makefile: changed 'mkdir -p' to '-mkdir -p'.
Configure script: added X_CFLAGS to smr_CHECK_LIB(Xpm).
Added Xpm_CFLAGS to xpdf/Makefile.in (this is needed to get the -I for
  the xpm includes).
Rewrote code that handles font encodings; added support for Type 1C
  fonts.
In the setpagedevice dictionary in PostScript output - added a
  /Policies entry which tells the PS interpreter to scale the page to
  fit the available paper.
Changed PageUp behavior slightly: move to bottom (instead of top) of
  previous page.
TextPage used character's dx (width + char space) instead of just its
  width.
Read base URI from document Catalog (for URI-type links).
Minor change to configure script to avoid using 'unset'.
Fixed bugs in CropBox inheritance.
Fixed a bug in resource stack handling for form objects.
Display forms even if they have a missing/incorrect FormType.
Fixed a bug in stream predictors -- the predictor parameters (width,
  comps, bits) don't need to match the actual image parameters.
  Completely rearranged the predictor code.
Fixed PostScript output to correctly handle stream predictors.
Don't segfault on empty (zero-page) documents.
Added the xpdf.viKeys feature.

Added a '-q' flag to all programs (except pdfinfo) to suppress
  messages and errors.
Deal with DeviceN colorspaces by using their alternate colorspace
  entry.
Change PostScript output so setpagedevice is only called once, at the
  very beginning of the document (to avoid problems on duplex
  printers).
Changes to configure script and makefiles for DOS/DJGPP.
FontEncoding::getCharCode() looked for (code>0) instead of (code>=0).

0.91 (2000-aug-14)
------------------
Added TrueType font rendering, using FreeType.
Support for Chinese fonts (Type 0 fonts using the Adobe-GB1-2
  character collection).
Decryption code is included with the main distribution (now that the
  US export regulations are a little bit less irrational).
Added (very basic) support for generating PostScript with Japanese
  fonts -- only tested with ghostscript so far.
Added support for generating EPS files (pdftops -eps).
Much-improved image filtering in xpdf (for downsampling and for
  transforms other than 0/90/180/270-degree rotations).
Implemented a basic full-screen (presentation) mode (xpdf
  -fullscreen).  (There is currently no way to switch between window
  and full-screen modes on the fly -- this will be fixed in a later
  release.)
Added "reload" menu item.
Do a better job with anti-aliased Type 1 fonts on non-white
  backgrounds.
Handle Lab color spaces.
Handle non-null user passwords.
Avoid security hole with tmpnam()/fopen() -- added openTempFile() in
  goo/gfile.cc.  [Thanks to Joseph S. Myers for pointing this out.]
Filter out quote marks (' and ") in URLs before running urlCommand to
  avoid a potential security hole.  [Thanks to Frank Doepper for
  pointing this out.]
Fixed TrueColor detection to look at the complete list of available
  visuals, not just the default visual.
In gfile.h, changed NAMLEN(dirent) macro to NAMLEN(d).
Removed copyright character from start-up banners.
In the open and save dialogs, if the open/save button is pressed with
  no file name, the dialog is not canceled.
Added Xpm_CFLAGS to ltk/Makefile.

  defined.
In top-level Makefile.in, use INSTALL_PROGRAM instead of INSTALL.
In man page, recommend -q instead of -err in .mailcap.
Changes for GNOME / Bonobo support:
  - Separated Stream classes into BaseStream and FilterStream trees.
  - Got rid of all FileStream-specific stuff.
  - Added a PDFDoc constructor that takes a BaseStream* instead of a
    file name.
Allow newlines inside strings (Photoshop does this).
Don't require whitespace between tokens in consecutive content
  streams (for pages that specify an array of streams).
Look at MissingWidth when constructing font character widths array.
Fixed a bug that caused incorrect PostScript output for images that
  use 8-bit indexed color spaces with < 256 colors in the palette.
Handle case where embedded font file is bad (this was seg faulting).
Minor changes for Windows/pdftex.
Work around a bug in PDF files from the IBM patent server.
Fixed bugs in PostScript form generation: use pdfStartPage instead of
  pdfSetup; problem with inline images.
Minor bug fix in FlateStream::loadFixedCodes().
Added %%DocumentMedia and %%PageMedia comments to the PostScript so
  that gsview (a Windows frontend for ghostscript) gets the right
  paper size.
Draw AcroForm fields that have appearance annotations.
Bounds check gray, CMYK, and RGB values (in GfxColor).
Moved the link border drawing code into Page (from PDFDoc).
Minor modifications for pdftohtml.
PSOutputDev: use the Type 3 font scaling kludge from XOutputDev.
Separation color spaces were handled incorrectly in images.
Fixed a bug with form bounding boxes.
Modified the t1lib support -- replace libt1x code with my own code.
  Type 1 and TrueType fonts are now handled similarly, and clipping
  works on Type 1 fonts.
Don't print copyright banner (xpdf); add -v switch to get copyright
  and version info (all apps); get rid of -err switch (xpdf).
Automatically reload the PDF file if it has been changed, i.e., if the
  modification time is different.
Fixed a memory (malloc size) bug in CCITTFaxStream.
Fixed two bugs in FontEncoding::hash() -- handle zero-length character
  names (which were found in a (buggy?) PDF file), and handle
  character names with high-bit-set characters (use unsigned ints).
Added PDFDoc::isLinearized() and corresponding code in pdfinfo.cc.
Handle files with an incorrect page count in the Pages dictionary
  (FOP, from the Apache project produces a page count of 0).
Handle TrueType equivalents to the Base14 fonts (Arial, TimesNewRoman,
  CourierNew) -- Adobe's tools use these names without embedding the
  fonts.
Tweaked the Type 3 font sizing kludge.
Changed pdfimages (ImageOutputDev) so it doesn't output JPEG files for
  4-component color spaces, since these seem to confuse most image
  viewers.
Added support for generating OPI comments (pdftops -opi).
In XOutputDev::drawImage() and drawImageMask(), check for images that
  are completely off-page.
Use the provided alternate or a default (DeviceGray/RGB/CMYK) color
  space for ICCBased color spaces.

  2.95 from barfing.
Support for Latin-2 and Latin-5 in pdftotext (however, this will only
  work if the PDF file contains correct font encodings, which seems to
  be rare).
TextOutputDev converts "eightoldstyle" to "eight", etc.
Don't use the return value from sprintf() -- most systems return the
  length, but some return the string.

  of looking for names beginning with a few specific letters.
T1FontFile::T1FontFile wasn't initializing vars, and ~T1FontFile

0.92e (2001-aug-23)
-------------------
Widths in font dict should override built-in font widths.
Changed "rotate left/right" menu items to "rotate

Stupid typo in font name table in PSOutputDev.
Changing the zoom setting with a keyboard shortcut didn't update the
  displayed setting.
Modified the mouse wheel support and added the second wheel (mouse
  buttons 6 and 7).  [Thanks to Michal Pasternak.]
Character and word spacing is affected by horizontal scaling (display
  and PS output).  [Thanks to Eddy Ng.]
Rotation specified by the text matrix, character spacing, and
  horizontal scaling interacted incorrectly (display and PS output).
Some broken Type 1/1C fonts have a zero BBox -- kludge around this by
  assuming a largeish BBox.
Handle PDF files with an incorrect (too small) xref table size.
Allow "-?" and "--help" as aliases for "-h" (all apps).
Correctly handle unescaped parens in strings in Lexer.

  problems with fonts that have non-standard FontMatrixes.
Add the Euro character to WinAnsiEncoding.
Track the bounding box of the clip region to make rendering patterns
  more efficient.
Fix openTempFile() for Win32.

0.93b (2001-dec-11)

The '0' keyboard shortcut didn't update the zoom popup menu.
Handle the complete list of alternate names for the Base14 fonts.
Fixed substitute font scaling in XOutputDev - scale only the width,
  not the height.

Handle the case of moveto/closepath/clip, which defines an empty
  clipping region.
Move dependences into separate Makefile.dep files; get rid of the

  interpreter is disabled (i.e., disable autohinting but not bytecode
  hinting); add some padding to the glyph cache for CJK fonts.

Improved the CMap file parser to handle more general PostScript
  lexical conventions.
Added '-enc' option to pdfinfo.
Added the small caps and oldstyle numbers from Adobe's Unicode
  corporate use area to the Latin1 and ASCII7 Unicode maps.
The code in TextOutputDev that guesses Type 3 font size could generate
  a zero size, which resulted in div-by-zero errors.
Various tools (including Adobe's) occasionally embed Type 1 fonts but
  label them Type 1C - so check for a '%!' at the start.
Some tools embed Type 1C fonts with an extra whitespace char at the
  beginning - just skip over it.

The OPI code was saving the default transform matrix before calling
  setpagedevice, which can change the matrix.
Fixed a crash when an inline image dictionary contains garbage.
Upgraded to autoconf 2.53.

  special fonts to do shading or cross-hatching; added the
  'textKeepTinyChars' option to disable this behavior.
Text extraction discards duplicated text (fake boldface, shadow
  effects).
Added ctrl-F as a key binding for find.
Added a "find next" function, bound to ctrl-G.

  fonts that have incorrect bboxes).
Reverse the colors in PBM files generated by pdfimages, so the common
  case (an image mask filled with black) comes out correct.

Change the default encoding for TrueType fonts (used when the PDF file
  doesn't specify an encoding) from MacRomanEncoding to
  WinAnsiEncoding.
Move X_CFLAGS to the end of the list in CXXFLAGS (in Makefile.in) to
  avoid some of the FreeType2 include path problems.
Fixed an obscure bug in the LZW decoder.  [Thanks to Martin
  Schroeder.]
Fixed a bug in decryption when using the newer (PDF 1.4) algorithm
  with shorter-than-128-bit keys.
Minor optimization for image data streams: the ImageStream class can
  return an entire buffered line.

------------------
Redesigned the text extraction process:
  - process the text into "reading order"

Added the -reload option for xpdf (in remote mode).
Added support for external CID fonts; added the displayCIDFontT1 and
  displayNamedCIDFontT1 commands to the xpdfrc file.

  to add vertical whitespace.
Config files whose last line didn't end with a LF (or CR+LF) weren't
  being handled correctly.

Added the Windows-1255 encoding to the Hebrew language package.
A missing NULL check was causing a crash when closing the file in a
  single window (which clears out the window, but leaves it open).
Deal with TrueType fonts whose glyph data is out of order - this
  affected both FreeType rasterization and PostScript generation.
Munge font names in PSOutputDev to avoid names that are problematic
  for ghostscript because they start with an out-of-limits number
  (e.g., 1e999foo).
Modify the TrueType font encoding deciphering algorithm in yet another
  attempt to match up with Acrobat's behavior.
Bounds check the indexHigh value in indexed color spaces.
The text extractor no longer bothers trying to get an average
  character width for Type 3 fonts, since it generally doesn't work
  very well (because Type 3 metrics are unreliable).
Don't crash if the user hits ctrl-G ("find again") before doing a
  find.
Set the button pixmap foreground color correctly.
Handle text drawn backward on 180 degree rotated pages.
Added a magic call to XtUngrabButton after calling XmCreatePopupMenu
  which appears to prevent some very odd problems (idea taken from the
  DDD source code).

Fixed a bunch of Motif 1.x / X11R5 incompatibilities.  [Thanks to
  William Bader and Albert Chin-A-Young.]

Avoid a potential divide-by-zero problem in TextOutputDev.
Modified the T1Font and FTFont modules to correctly handle glyphs that
  are larger than the font's claimed bounding box.
Tweak dupMaxDeltaX parameter in TextOutputDev to avoid triggering on

  don't drop pixels on the right and bottom edges.
Tell FreeType not to use glyph bitmaps when in anti-aliased mode.
Read all of the border style info for links.
All of the shaded fill types now do at least one bisection to avoid

  Siegert.]
PSOutputDev was generating incorrect translations for landscape-mode
  pages.
Implemented shading pattern color spaces.
PSOutputDev wasn't correctly handling Type 3 fonts which used image

  item's Next pointer to point to itself.
PSOutputDev was not handling DeviceN color spaces correctly in Level 2
  images.
Fixed a stupid little bug that broke PS output for JBIG2 images.
Work around a Lesstif bug: set up an extra callback so hitting <Enter>
  in the find dialog performs a search.  [Thanks to Elliott Hughes.]
Pdftops was crashing on zero page PDF files.

  [Thanks to Frank Siegert.]
Fix a bug in tiling patterns with bboxes that don't start at (0,0).
Fix a bug in Type 3 font handling with rotated text.
The tiled pattern fill code was destroying the current path, which
  broke the fill+stroke operators when the fill color space was a
  tiled pattern.
ICCBased color spaces don't always set their Ranges values correctly,
  so just use the values from the alternate color space.
Modified GHash to accept int or void* - this avoids some conversion
  warnings.
Check for missing Type 3 CharProcs - avoid a segfault.
Pdffonts now marks all Type 3 fonts as embedded.
Outline entries with no Title string weren't being handled correctly,
  resulting in segfaults.
PSOutputDev now forces the text horizontal scale factor to be non-zero
  to avoid singular font matrices in the PS code.
Tweaked the error recovery in the CCITTFax decoder.
The LZW/Flate predictor should treat any Predictor value (in the
  stream dictionary) >= 10 identically.
PSOutputDev and pdffonts check for NULL font objects (which can
  happen, e.g., because of missing CMap files).

EPS output ("pdftops -eps") now uses the CropBox instead of the
  MediaBox as the EPS bounding box.

3.01 (2005-aug-17)
------------------
Added the continuous view mode, including the '-cont' switch and the
  'continuousView' config file option.

Move an inline function in JArithmeticDecoder.cc to avoid compiler
  errors.
Fixed a bug in the rasterizer that was sometimes causing infinite
  loops with round line caps on vertical lines.
Various rasterizer optimizations.

Fixed a bug handling empty paths.
Fixed a text positioning problem in PostScript output.
Handle TrueType collections in FoFiTrueType.cc.
FoFiTrueType constructor was reporting a failure if the post table was

Check for singular text matrices and font size of zero in PSOutputDev.
Clip PS output to the size of the page (avoiding any gibberish that
  lies outside the MediaBox, in the case where the MediaBox is smaller
  than the paper).
If the line dash element in an annotation's Border array is of an
  invalid type (i.e., not an array), don't draw the link at all (this
  matches Adobe's behavior).
Don't remap small caps and oldstyle glyphs in the name-to-Unicode
  table - it messes up TrueType font encodings.
Pdftoppm wasn't setting the paper color correctly in mono and gray
  modes (this only showed up on big-endian machines).
Missing NULL check was causing crashes when attempting to read non-PDF
  files that happened to contain the string '%PDF'.

  components that are not 1 or 8 bits wide.
Optimized FlateStream::loadFixedCodes().
For non-embedded Base-14 fonts, don't use the ascent/descent/bbox
  values from the FontDescriptor - various PDF generators get them

  in tables) were being split vertically onto multiple lines.
Automatically select the correct radio button ("print with command"
  vs. "print to file") in the print dialog.
Don't create the "open" and "save as" dialogs until needed - this

  algorithm.
Don't completely invalidate the Catalog if one (or more) of the page
  objects are bogus -- just skip over those pages.
Removed the workaround in pdftops for too-small Length2 values in Type
  1 fonts -- it was causing problems on various PostScript printers.
Started adding error checking to the JBIG2 decoder (this is nowhere
  near complete yet).

Be a bit more tolerant of Link destinations that contain null values
  for positioning parameters.
Use ordered dot dithering instead of clustered dot dithering at 
  resolutions below 300 dpi (for monochrome output).
Fixed security holes (bounds checking issues) in several places.

  are only used for hidden text - this avoids problems with fonts of
  unreasonably large sizes.
Clipping in TextOutputDev was off for characters on the left edge of
  the page.
The scn and SCN operators weren't correctly handling colors with more
  than four components.
FoFiType1::writeEncoded wasn't always correctly finding the end of the
  encoding.
Use the ColorTransform parameter in the DCTDecode stream dictionary.
Type 3 fonts are allowed to have a bbox of [0 0 0 0], which means
  "unspecified" -- don't issue error messages in that case.
Perform the transform (to device space) in Splash instead of in
  SplashOutputDev -- this is needed to correctly handle round joins
  and caps on stroked paths.
PSOutputDev now rasterizes any pages that use transparency.
Limit the crop, bleed, trim, and art boxes to the edges of the media
  box (per the PDF spec).
Change GString to increase the allocation increment by powers of two.

  deadlock when parseCIDToUnicode() or parseUnicodeToUnicode() calls
  it from inside a locked section.
Added error checking (on the argument count) in the sc/SC/scn/SCN
  operators.
Skip over notdef glyphs in TrueType fonts (which sometimes get drawn
  as little boxes), to match Adobe's behavior.
Painting operations in a Separation color space with the "None"
  colorant or a DeviceN color space with all colorants set to "None"
  never mark the page.
Fixed an obscure bug in the JPX decoder - it wasn't reading the extra
  stuffing byte in the case where the last byte of a packet header was
  0xff.

Changed the color key / explicit masked image code in PSOutputDev to
  generate better PS code, including a Level 3 option.
Tweaked the DEBUG_MEM code for performance.
Move the JBIG2 global stream reading code into reset() instead of the
  constructor - this way, pdftotext doesn't end up reading the global
  stream.
Added the "-preload" option to pdftops and the psPreload xpdfrc
  command.
Added the "zoom to selection" command (on the popup menu).
Fix a bug (in xpdf/pdftoppm/pdftops) with tiling patterns whose bbox
  size is different from their xStep/yStep.
Implemented stroke with pattern color spaces.
Following a link to a page whose CropBox was different from the
  MediaBox was resulting in an incorrect scroll position.
Parse truncated date strings from the Info dictionary correctly.
