       pdftops  -  Portable  Document  Format (PDF) to PostScript
       converter

       pdftops [options] [PDF-file [PS-file]]

       Pdftops converts Portable Document Format (PDF)  files  to
       PostScript so they can be printed.

       Pdftops  reads  the  PDF  file,  PDF-file,  and  writes  a
       PostScript file, PS-file.  If PS-file  is  not  specified,
       pdftops converts file.pdf to file.ps (or file.eps with the
       -eps option).  If PS-file is '-', the PostScript  is  sent
       to stdout.

                                                               ()

2 ONFIGURATION_FIL

       Pdftops  reads  a configuration file at startup.  It first
       tries to find the user's private config  file,  ~/.xpdfrc.
       If  that  doesn't exist, it looks for a system-wide config
       file, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc (but  this  location
       can  be changed when pdftops is built).  See the xpdfrc(5)
       man page for details.

2 OPTIONS

       Many  of  the following options can be set with configura-
       tion file commands.  These are listed in  square  brackets
       with  the  description  of  the corresponding command line
       option.

       -f number
              Specifies the first page to print.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to print.

       -level1
              Generate  Level  1   PostScript.    The   resulting
              PostScript  files  will be significantly larger (if
              they contain images), but will  print  on  Level  1
              printers.   This  also converts all images to black
              and white.  No more  than  one  of  the  PostScript
              level   options   (-level1,   -level1sep,  -level2,
              -level2sep,  -level3,  -level3Sep)  may  be  given.
              [config file: psLevel]

       -level1sep
              Generate  Level 1 separable PostScript.  All colors
              are converted to CMYK.   Images  are  written  with
              separate  stream  data  for  the  four  components.
              [config file: psLevel]

       -level2
              Generate Level  2  PostScript.   Level  2  supports
              color  images  and  image compression.  This is the
              default setting.  [config file: psLevel]

       -level2sep
              Generate Level 2 separable PostScript.  All  colors
              are  converted  to CMYK.  The PostScript separation
              convention operators  are  used  to  handle  custom
              (spot) colors.  [config file: psLevel]

       -level3
              Generate  Level  3  PostScript.   This  enables all
              Level 2 features plus CID font embedding and masked
              image generation.  [config file: psLevel]

       -level3Sep
              Generate Level 3 separable PostScript.  The separa-
              tion handling is the same as for -level2Sep.  [con-
              fig file: psLevel]

       -eps   Generate an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file.  An
              EPS file contains a single image,  so  if  you  use
              this  option  with  a multi-page PDF file, you must
              use -f and -l to specify a single  page.   No  more
              than  one  of the mode options (-eps, -form) may be
              given.

       -form  Generate a PostScript form which can be imported by
              software that understands forms.  A form contains a
              single page, so if  you  use  this  option  with  a
              multi-page  PDF  file,  you  must  use -f and -l to
              specify a single page.  The -level1  option  cannot
              be used with -form.

       -opi   Generate  OPI  comments  for  all  images and forms
              which have OPI information.  (This option  is  only
              available  if  pdftops  was  compiled with OPI sup-
              port.)  [config file: psOPI]

       -noembt1
              By default, any Type 1 fonts which are embedded  in
              the  PDF  file are copied into the PostScript file.
              This option causes pdftops to substitute base fonts
              instead.   Embedded  fonts  make  PostScript  files
              larger, but may be necessary for  readable  output.
              [config file: psEmbedType1Fonts]

       -noembtt
              By  default,  any TrueType fonts which are embedded
              in the PDF file  are  copied  into  the  PostScript
              file.   This  option  causes  pdftops to substitute
              base fonts instead.  Embedded fonts make PostScript
              files  larger,  but  may  be necessary for readable
              output.  Also, some PostScript interpreters do  not
              have  TrueType  rasterizers.   [config  file: psEm-
              bedTrueTypeFonts]

       -noembcidps
              By default, any  CID  PostScript  fonts  which  are
              embedded  in  the  PDF  file  are  copied  into the
              PostScript file.  This option disables that  embed-
              ding.   No  attempt  is made to substitute for non-
              embedded CID PostScript fonts.  [config file: psEm-
              bedCIDPostScriptFonts]

       -noembcidtt
              By default, any CID TrueType fonts which are embed-
              ded in the PDF file are copied into the  PostScript
              file.   This  option  disables  that embedding.  No
              attempt is made to substitute for non-embedded  CID
              TrueType  fonts.  [config file: psEmbedCIDTrueType-
              Fonts]

       -preload
              Convert PDF forms to  PS  procedures,  and  preload
              image   data.    This   uses  more  memory  in  the
              PostScript interpreter, but generates significantly
              smaller  PS  files  in  situations where, e.g., the
              same image is drawn on every page of a  long  docu-
              ment.

       -paper size
              Set  the  paper  size  to one of "letter", "legal",
              "A4", or "A3".  This can also be  set  to  "match",
              which  will  set  the  paper size to match the size
              specified in the PDF file.  [config file:  psPaper-
              Size]

       -paperw size
              Set  the  paper  width,  in  points.  [config file:
              psPaperSize]

       -paperh size
              Set the paper height,  in  points.   [config  file:
              psPaperSize]

       -nocrop
              By default, output is cropped to the CropBox speci-
              fied  in  the  PDF  file.   This  option   disables
              cropping.  [config file: psCrop]

       -expand
              Expand PDF pages smaller than the paper to fill the
              paper.  By default, these  pages  are  not  scaled.
              [config file: psExpandSmaller]

       -noshrink
              Don't  scale  PDF  pages  which are larger than the
              paper.  By default, pages larger than the paper are
              shrunk to fit.  [config file: psShrinkLarger]

       -nocenter
              By default, PDF pages smaller than the paper (after
              any scaling)  are  centered  on  the  paper.   This
              option  causes them to be aligned to the lower-left
              corner of the paper instead.  [config file:  psCen-
              ter]

       -pagecrop
              Treat  the  CropBox  as  the  PDF  page  size.   By
              default, the MediaBox is used as the page size.

       -duplex
              Set the Duplex pagedevice entry in  the  PostScript
              file.  This tells duplex-capable printers to enable
              duplexing.  [config file: psDuplex]

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.   Pro-
              viding  this will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -q     Don't print any messages or errors.  [config  file:
              errQuiet]

       -cfg config-file
              Read  config-file in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the sys-
              tem-wide config file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.   (-help  and  --help  are
              equivalent.)

                                                               ()

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
