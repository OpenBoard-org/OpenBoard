.SH NAME
xpdf \- Portable Document Format (PDF) file viewer for X (version 3.02)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xpdf
[options]
.RI [ PDF-file
.RI [ page " | +" dest ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Xpdf
is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.  (These are also
sometimes also called \'Acrobat' files, from the name of Adobe's PDF
software.)  Xpdf runs under the X Window System on UNIX, VMS, and
OS/2.
.PP
To run xpdf, simply type:
.PP
.RS
xpdf file.pdf
.RE
.PP
where
.I file.pdf
is your PDF file.  The file name can be followed by a number
specifying the page which should be displayed first, e.g.:
.PP
.RS
xpdf file.pdf 18
.RE
.PP
You can also give a named destination, prefixed with \'+' in place of
the page number.  (This is only useful with PDF files that provide
named destination targets.)
.PP
You can also start xpdf without opening any files:

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
Xpdf reads a configuration file at startup.  It first tries to find
the user's private config file, ~/.xpdfrc.  If that doesn't exist, it
looks for a system-wide config file, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc
(but this location can be changed when xpdf is built).  See the
.BR xpdfrc (5)
man page for details.
.SH OPTIONS
Many of the following options can be set with configuration file
commands or X resources.  These are listed in square brackets with the
description of the corresponding command line option.
.TP
.BI \-g " geometry"
Set the initial window geometry.
.RB ( \-geometry
is equivalent.)
.RB "[X resource: " xpdf.geometry ]
.TP
.BI \-title " title"
Set the window title.  By default, the title will be "xpdf: foo.pdf".
.RB "[X resource: " xpdf.title ]
.TP
.B \-cmap
Install a private colormap.  This is ignored on TrueColor visuals.
.RB "[X resource: " xpdf.installCmap ]
.TP
.BI \-rgb " number"
Set the size of largest RGB cube xpdf will try to allocate.  The
default is 5 (for a 5x5x5 cube); set to a smaller number to conserve
color table entries.  This is ignored with private colormaps and on
TrueColor visuals.
.RB "[X resource: " xpdf.rgbCubeSize ]
.TP
.B \-rv
Set reverse video mode.  This reverses the colors of everything except
images.  It may not always produce great results for PDF files which
do weird things with color.  This also causes the paper color to
default to black.
.RB "[X resource: " xpdf.reverseVideo ]
.TP
.BI \-papercolor " color"
Set the "paper color", i.e., the background of the page display.  This
will not work too well with PDF files that do things like filling in
white behind the text.
.RB "[X resource: " xpdf.paperColor ]
.TP
.BI \-mattecolor " color"
Set the matte color, i.e., the color used for background outside the
actual page area.  (There is a separate setting,
xpdf.fullScreenMatteColor, for full-screen mode.)
.RB "[X resource: " xpdf.matteColor ]
.TP
.BI \-z " zoom"
Set the initial zoom factor.  A number specifies a zoom percentage,
where 100 means 72 dpi.You may also specify \'page', to fit the page
to the window size, or \'width', to fit the page width to the window
width.
.RB "[config file: " initialZoom "; or X resource: " xpdf.initialZoom ]
.TP
.B \-cont
Start in continuous view mode, i.e., with one vertical scroll bar for
the whole document.
.RB "[config file: " continuousView ]
.TP
.BI \-t1lib " yes | no"
Enable or disable t1lib (a Type 1 font rasterizer).  This defaults to
"yes".
.RB "[config file: " enableT1lib ]
.TP
.BI \-freetype " yes | no"
Enable or disable FreeType (a TrueType / Type 1 font rasterizer).
This defaults to "yes".
.RB "[config file: " enableFreeType ]
.TP
.BI \-aa " yes | no"
Enable or disable font anti-aliasing.  This defaults to "yes".
.RB "[config file: " antialias ]
.TP
.BI \-aaVector " yes | no"
Enable or disable vector anti-aliasing.  This defaults to "yes".
.RB "[config file: " vectorAntialias ]
.TP
.BI \-ps " PS-file"
Set the default file name for PostScript output (i.e., the name which
will appear in the print dialog).  This can also be of the form
\'|command' to pipe the PostScript through a command.
.RB "[config file: " psFile ]
.TP
.BI \-paper " size"
Set the paper size to one of "letter", "legal", "A4", or "A3".  This
can also be set to "match", which will set the paper size to match the
size specified in the PDF file.
.RB "[config file: " psPaperSize ]
.TP
.BI \-paperw " size"
Set the paper width, in points.
.RB "[config file: " psPaperSize ]
.TP
.BI \-paperh " size"
Set the paper height, in points.
.RB "[config file: " psPaperSize ]
.TP
.B \-level1
Generate Level 1 PostScript.  The resulting PostScript files will be
significantly larger (if they contain images), but will print on Level
1 printers.  This also converts all images to black and white.
.RB "[config file: " psLevel ]
.TP
.BI \-enc " encoding-name"
Sets the encoding to use for text output.  The
.I encoding\-name
must be defined with the unicodeMap command (see
.BR xpdfrc (5)).
This defaults to "Latin1" (which is a built-in encoding).
.RB "[config file: " textEncoding ]
.TP
.BI \-eol " unix | dos | mac"
Sets the end-of-line convention to use for text output.
.RB "[config file: " textEOL ]
.TP
.BI \-opw " password"
Specify the owner password for the PDF file.  Providing this will
bypass all security restrictions.
.TP

Specify the user password for the PDF file.
.TP
.B \-fullscreen
Open xpdf in full-screen mode, useful for presentations.
.TP
.BI \-remote " name"

Read
.I config-file
in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the system-wide config file.
.TP
.B \-v
Print copyright and version information.
.TP
.B \-h
Print usage information.
.RB ( \-help
and
.B \-\-help
are equivalent.)
.PP
Several other standard X options and resources will work as expected:
.TP
.BI \-display " display"
.RB "[X resource: " xpdf.display ]
.TP
.BI \-fg " color"
.RB ( \-foreground
is equivalent.)
.RB "[X resource: " xpdf*Foreground ]
.TP
.BI \-bg " color"
.RB ( \-background
is equivalent.)
.RB "[X resource: " xpdf*Background ]
.TP
.BI \-font " font"
.RB ( \-fn
is equivalent.)
.RB "[X resource: " xpdf*fontList ]
.PP
The color and font options only affect the user interface elements,
not the PDF display (the \'paper').
.PP
The following X resources do not have command line option equivalents:
.TP

.SH "WEB BROWSERS"
If you want to run xpdf automatically from netscape or mosaic (and
probably other browsers) when you click on a link to a PDF file, you
need to edit (or create) the files
.I .mime.types
and
.I .mailcap
in your home directory.  In
.I .mime.types
add the line:
.PP
.RS
application/pdf pdf
.RE
.PP
In
.I .mailcap
add the lines:
.PP
.RS
# Use xpdf to view PDF files.
.RE
.RS
application/pdf; xpdf -q %s
.RE
.PP
Make sure that xpdf is on your executable search path.
.PP
When you click on a URL link in a PDF file, xpdf will execute the
command specified by the urlCommand config file option, replacing an
occurrence of \'%s' with the URL.  For example, to call netscape with
the URL, add this line to your config file:
.PP
.RS
urlCommand "netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'"
.RE
.SH COMMANDS
Xpdf's key and mouse bindings are user-configurable, using the bind and
unbind options in the config file (see
.BR xpdfrc (5)).
The bind command allows you to bind a key or mouse button to a
sequence of one or more commands.

.SH "REMOTE SERVER MODE"
Xpdf can be started in remote server mode by specifying a server name
(in addition to the file name and page number).  For example:
.PP
.RS
xpdf -remote myServer file.pdf
.RE
.PP
If there is currently no xpdf running in server mode with the name
\'myServer', a new xpdf window will be opened.  If another command:
.PP
.RS
xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 9
.RE
.PP
is issued, a new copy of xpdf will not be started.  Instead, the first
xpdf (the server) will load
.I another.pdf
and display page nine.  If the file name is the same:
.PP
.RS
xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 4
.RE
.PP
the xpdf server will simply display the specified page.
.PP
The -raise option tells the server to raise its window; it can be
specified with or without a file name and page number.
.PP
The -quit option tells the server to close its window and exit.
