       pdftotext  -  Portable  Document Format (PDF) to text con-
       verter

       pdftotext [options] [PDF-file [text-file]]

       Pdftotext converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files to
       plain text.

       Pdftotext  reads the PDF file, PDF-file, and writes a text
       file, text-file.  If text-file is not specified, pdftotext
       converts  file.pdf  to file.txt.  If text-file is '-', the
       text is sent to stdout.

                                                               ()

2 ONFIGURATION_FIL

       Pdftotext reads a configuration file at startup.  It first
       tries to find the user's private config  file,  ~/.xpdfrc.
       If  that  doesn't exist, it looks for a system-wide config
       file, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc (but  this  location
       can   be  changed  when  pdftotext  is  built).   See  the
       xpdfrc(5) man page for details.

2 OPTIONS

       Many  of  the following options can be set with configura-
       tion file commands.  These are listed in  square  brackets
       with  the  description  of  the corresponding command line
       option.

       -f number
              Specifies the first page to convert.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to convert.

       -layout
              Maintain (as best as possible) the original  physi-
              cal  layout  of the text.  The default is to 'undo'
              physical layout (columns,  hyphenation,  etc.)  and
              output the text in reading order.

       -raw   Keep  the  text in content stream order.  This is a
              hack which often "undoes" column  formatting,  etc.
              Use of raw mode is no longer recommended.

       -htmlmeta
              Generate  a  simple  HTML  file, including the meta
              information.  This simply wraps the text  in  <pre>
              and </pre> and prepends the meta headers.

       -enc encoding-name
              Sets  the  encoding  to  use  for text output.  The
              encoding-name must be defined with  the  unicodeMap
              command  (see  xpdfrc(5)).   The  encoding  name is
              case-sensitive.  This defaults to  "Latin1"  (which
              is  a built-in encoding).  [config file: textEncod-
              ing]

       -eol unix | dos | mac
              Sets the end-of-line convention  to  use  for  text
              output.  [config file: textEOL]

       -nopgbrk
              Don't  insert  page  breaks  (form feed characters)
              between pages.  [config file: textPageBreaks]

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.   Pro-
              viding  this will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -q     Don't print any messages or errors.  [config  file:
              errQuiet]

       -cfg config-file
              Read  config-file in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the sys-
              tem-wide config file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.   (-help  and  --help  are
              equivalent.)

2 BUGS

       Some  PDF  files  contain  fonts whose encodings have been
       mangled beyond recognition.  There is  no  way  (short  of
       OCR) to extract text from these files.

                                                               ()

2 XIT_CODE

       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
