NAME
       xpdf  -  Portable  Document Format (PDF) file viewer for X
       (version 3.02)

SYNOPSIS
       xpdf [options] [PDF-file [page | +dest]]

DESCRIPTION
       Xpdf is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
       (These  are  also  sometimes  also called 'Acrobat' files,
       from the name of Adobe's PDF software.)  Xpdf  runs  under
       the X Window System on UNIX, VMS, and OS/2.

       To run xpdf, simply type:

              xpdf file.pdf

       where  file.pdf  is  your  PDF file.  The file name can be
       followed by a number specifying the page which  should  be
       displayed first, e.g.:

              xpdf file.pdf 18

       You  can  also give a named destination, prefixed with '+'
       in place of the page number.  (This is  only  useful  with
       PDF files that provide named destination targets.)

       You can also start xpdf without opening any files:

              xpdf

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Xpdf  reads  a  configuration  file  at startup.  It first
       tries to find the user's private config  file,  ~/.xpdfrc.
       If  that  doesn't exist, it looks for a system-wide config
       file, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc (but  this  location
       can be changed when xpdf is built).  See the xpdfrc(5) man
       page for details.

OPTIONS
       Many of the following options can be set  with  configura-
       tion  file  commands  or X resources.  These are listed in
       square brackets with the description of the  corresponding
       command line option.

       -g geometry
              Set  the  initial  window  geometry.  (-geometry is
              equivalent.)  [X resource: xpdf.geometry]

       -title title
              Set the window title.  By default, the  title  will
              be "xpdf: foo.pdf".  [X resource: xpdf.title]

       -cmap  Install  a  private  colormap.   This is ignored on
              TrueColor visuals.  [X resource: xpdf.installCmap]

       -rgb number
              Set the size of largest RGB cube xpdf will  try  to
              allocate.  The default is 5 (for a 5x5x5 cube); set
              to  a  smaller  number  to  conserve  color   table
              entries.   This  is  ignored with private colormaps
              and   on   TrueColor   visuals.     [X    resource:
              xpdf.rgbCubeSize]

       -rv    Set  reverse  video mode.  This reverses the colors
              of everything except images.   It  may  not  always
              produce  great results for PDF files which do weird
              things with color.   This  also  causes  the  paper
              color   to   default   to   black.    [X  resource:
              xpdf.reverseVideo]

       -papercolor color
              Set the "paper color", i.e., the background of  the
              page display.  This will not work too well with PDF
              files that do things like filling in  white  behind
              the text.  [X resource: xpdf.paperColor]

       -mattecolor color
              Set the matte color, i.e., the color used for back-
              ground outside the actual page area.  (There  is  a
              separate  setting,  xpdf.fullScreenMatteColor,  for
              full-screen mode.)  [X resource: xpdf.matteColor]

       -z zoom
              Set the initial zoom factor.  A number specifies  a
              zoom  percentage,  where  100  means 72 dpi.You may
              also specify 'page', to fit the page to the  window
              size, or 'width', to fit the page width to the win-
              dow  width.   [config  file:  initialZoom;   or   X
              resource: xpdf.initialZoom]

       -cont  Start  in continuous view mode, i.e., with one ver-
              tical scroll bar for the whole  document.   [config
              file: continuousView]

       -t1lib yes | no
              Enable or disable t1lib (a Type 1 font rasterizer).
              This defaults to "yes".  [config file: enableT1lib]

       -freetype yes | no
              Enable  or  disable  FreeType  (a TrueType / Type 1
              font rasterizer).  This defaults to "yes".  [config
              file: enableFreeType]

       -aa yes | no
              Enable   or   disable   font  anti-aliasing.   This
              defaults to "yes".  [config file: antialias]

       -aaVector yes | no
              Enable  or  disable  vector  anti-aliasing.    This
              defaults to "yes".  [config file: vectorAntialias]

       -ps PS-file
              Set  the  default  file  name for PostScript output
              (i.e., the name which will appear in the print dia-
              log).   This  can also be of the form '|command' to
              pipe the PostScript  through  a  command.   [config
              file: psFile]

       -paper size
              Set  the  paper  size  to one of "letter", "legal",
              "A4", or "A3".  This can also be  set  to  "match",
              which  will  set  the  paper size to match the size
              specified in the PDF file.  [config file:  psPaper-
              Size]

       -paperw size
              Set  the  paper  width,  in  points.  [config file:
              psPaperSize]

       -paperh size
              Set the paper height,  in  points.   [config  file:
              psPaperSize]

       -level1
              Generate   Level   1   PostScript.   The  resulting
              PostScript files will be significantly  larger  (if
              they  contain  images),  but  will print on Level 1
              printers.  This also converts all images  to  black
              and white.  [config file: psLevel]

       -enc encoding-name
              Sets  the  encoding  to  use  for text output.  The
              encoding-name must be defined with  the  unicodeMap
              command (see xpdfrc(5)).  This defaults to "Latin1"
              (which is a built-in encoding).  [config file: tex-
              tEncoding]

       -eol unix | dos | mac
              Sets  the  end-of-line  convention  to use for text
              output.  [config file: textEOL]

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.   Pro-
              viding  this will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -fullscreen
              Open xpdf in full-screen mode, useful for presenta-
              tions.

       -remote name
              Start/contact  xpdf  remote  server  with specified
              name (see the REMOTE SERVER MODE section below).

       -exec command
              Execute a command (see the COMMANDS section  below)
              in  an  xpdf  remote  server  window  (with -remote
              only).

       -reload
              Reload xpdf  remote  server  window  (with  -remote
              only).

       -raise Raise  xpdf  remote  server  window  (with  -remote
              only).

       -quit  Kill xpdf remote server (with -remote only).

       -cmd   Print commands  as  they're  executed  (useful  for
              debugging).  [config file: printCommands]

       -q     Don't  print any messages or errors.  [config file:
              errQuiet]

       -cfg config-file
              Read config-file in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the  sys-
              tem-wide config file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print  usage  information.   (-help  and --help are
              equivalent.)

       Several other standard X options and resources  will  work
       as expected:

       -display display
              [X resource: xpdf.display]

       -fg color
              (-foreground    is   equivalent.)    [X   resource:
              xpdf*Foreground]

       -bg color
              (-background   is   equivalent.)    [X    resource:
              xpdf*Background]

       -font font
              (-fn is equivalent.)  [X resource: xpdf*fontList]

       The  color and font options only affect the user interface
       elements, not the PDF display (the 'paper').

       The following X resources do not have command line  option
       equivalents:

       xpdf.toolTipEnable
              Enables  (if  set  to  true) or disables (if set to
              false) the tool-tips on the toolbar buttons.

       xpdf.fullScreenMatteColor
              Sets the matte color  to  be  used  in  full-screen
              mode.  The default setting is "black".

       binoculars button
              Find a text string.

       print button
              Bring up a dialog for generating a PostScript file.
              The  dialog  has  options  to  set  the pages to be
              printed and the PostScript  file  name.   The  file
              name  can  be  '-' for stdout or '|command' to pipe
              the PostScript through a command, e.g., '|lpr'.

       '?' button
              Bring up the 'about xpdf' window.

       link info
              The space between the '?'  and  'Quit'  buttons  is
              used to show the URL or external file name when the
              mouse is over a link.

       'Quit' button
              Quit xpdf.


   Menu
       Pressing the right mouse button will  post  a  popup  menu
       with the following commands:

       Open...
              Open a new PDF file via a file requester.

       Open in new window...
              Create  a  new window and open a new PDF file via a
              file requester.

       Reload Reload the current PDF file.  Note that  Xpdf  will
              reload  the file automatically (on a page change or
              redraw) if it has changed since it was last loaded.

       Save as...
              Save the current file via a file requester.

       Continuous view
              Toggles  between  single  page  and continuous view
              modes.

       Rotate counterclockwise
              Rotate the page 90 degrees counterclockwise.

       Rotate clockwise
              Rotate the page  90  degrees  clockwise.   The  two
              rotate  commands  are  intended  primarily  for PDF
              files where the rotation isn't correctly  specified
              in the file.

       Zoom to selection
              Zoom in to the currently selected rectangle.

       Close  Close the current window.  If this is the only open
              window, the document is closed, but the  window  is
              left  open  (i.e.,  this  menu  command  won't quit
              xpdf).

       Quit   Quit xpdf.


   Outline
       If the PDF contains an outline (a.k.a., bookmarks),  there
       will  be  an  outline pane on the left side of the window.
       The width of the outline pane is adjustable with a  verti-
       cal split bar via the knob near its bottom end.


   Text selection
       Dragging  the  mouse  with  the left button held down will
       highlight an arbitrary rectangle.  Any  text  inside  this
       rectangle will be copied to the X selection buffer.


   Links
       Clicking   on   a   hyperlink  will  jump  to  the  link's
       destination.  A link to another  PDF  document  will  make
       xpdf load that document.  A 'launch' link to an executable
       program will display a dialog, and if you click 'ok', exe-
       cute the program.  URL links call an external command (see
       the WEB BROWSERS section below).


   Panning
       Dragging the mouse with the middle button held  down  pans
       the window.


   Key bindings

       alt-F  Toggle full-screen mode.

       q      Quit xpdf.

WEB BROWSERS
       If  you  want  to  run xpdf automatically from netscape or
       mosaic (and probably other browsers) when you click  on  a
       link to a PDF file, you need to edit (or create) the files
       .mime.types and  .mailcap  in  your  home  directory.   In
       .mime.types add the line:

              application/pdf pdf

       In .mailcap add the lines:

              # Use xpdf to view PDF files.
              application/pdf; xpdf -q %s

       Make sure that xpdf is on your executable search path.

       When you click on a URL link in a PDF file, xpdf will exe-
       cute the command specified by the urlCommand  config  file
       option, replacing an occurrence of '%s' with the URL.  For
       example, to call netscape with the URL, add this  line  to
       your config file:

              urlCommand "netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'"

COMMANDS
       Xpdf's key and mouse bindings are user-configurable, using
       the bind and  unbind  options  in  the  config  file  (see
       xpdfrc(5)).   The bind command allows you to bind a key or
       mouse button to a sequence of one or more commands.

   Available Commands

           bind Q              any         quit

       Previous versions of xpdf included a "viKeys" X  resource.
       It  is no longer available, but the following bindings are
       equivalent:

           bind h any scrollLeft(16)
           bind l any scrollRight(16)
           bind k any scrollUp(16)
           bind j any scrollDown(16)


REMOTE SERVER MODE
       Xpdf can be started in remote server mode by specifying  a
       server  name  (in  addition to the file name and page num-
       ber).  For example:

              xpdf -remote myServer file.pdf

       If there is currently no xpdf running in server mode  with
       the name 'myServer', a new xpdf window will be opened.  If
       another command:

              xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 9

       is issued, a  new  copy  of  xpdf  will  not  be  started.
       Instead, the first xpdf (the server) will load another.pdf
       and display page nine.  If the file name is the same:

              xpdf -remote myServer another.pdf 4

       the xpdf server will simply display the specified page.

       The -raise option tells the server to raise its window; it
       can be specified with or without a file name and page num-
       ber.

       The -quit option tells the server to close its window  and
       exit.

EXIT CODES
       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
