NAME
       pdfinfo - Portable Document Format (PDF) document informa-
       tion extractor (version 3.02)

SYNOPSIS
       pdfinfo [options] [PDF-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdfinfo prints the contents of the 'Info' dictionary (plus
       some  other  useful  information) from a Portable Document
       Format (PDF) file.

       The 'Info' dictionary contains the following values:

              title
              subject
              keywords
              author
              creator
              producer
              creation date
              modification date

       In addition, the following information is printed:

              tagged (yes/no)
              page count
              encrypted flag (yes/no)
              print and copy permissions (if encrypted)
              page size
              file size
              linearized (yes/no)
              PDF version
              metadata (only if requested)

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Pdfinfo reads a configuration file at startup.   It  first
       tries  to  find the user's private config file, ~/.xpdfrc.
       If that doesn't exist, it looks for a  system-wide  config
       file,  typically  /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc (but this location
       can be changed when pdfinfo is built).  See the  xpdfrc(5)
       man page for details.

OPTIONS
       Many  of  the following options can be set with configura-
       tion file commands.  These are listed in  square  brackets
       with  the  description  of  the corresponding command line
       option.

       -f number
              Specifies the first page to examine.   If  multiple
              pages   are  requested  using  the  "-f"  and  "-l"
              options, the size  of  each  requested  page  (and,
              optionally,  the  bounding boxes for each requested
              page) are printed.  Otherwise,  only  page  one  is
              examined.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to examine.

       -box   Prints the page box bounding boxes: MediaBox, Crop-
              Box, BleedBox, TrimBox, and ArtBox.

       -meta  Prints  document-level  metadata.   (This  is   the
              "Metadata"  stream  from  the  PDF  file's  Catalog
              object.)

       -enc encoding-name
              Sets the encoding to  use  for  text  output.   The
              encoding-name  must  be defined with the unicodeMap
              command (see xpdfrc(5)).  This defaults to "Latin1"
              (which is a built-in encoding).  [config file: tex-
              tEncoding]

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.   Pro-
              viding  this will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -cfg config-file
              Read config-file in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the  sys-
              tem-wide config file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print  usage  information.   (-help  and --help are
              equivalent.)

EXIT CODES
       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
