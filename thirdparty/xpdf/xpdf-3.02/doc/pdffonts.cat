NAME
       pdffonts  -  Portable  Document Format (PDF) font analyzer
       (version 3.02)

SYNOPSIS
       pdffonts [options] [PDF-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdffonts lists the fonts used in a Portable Document  For-
       mat  (PDF)  file  along  with various information for each
       font.

       The following information is listed for each font:

       name   the font name, exactly as given  in  the  PDF  file
              (potentially including a subset prefix)

       type   the font type -- see below for details

       emb    "yes" if the font is embedded in the PDF file

       sub    "yes" if the font is a subset

       uni    "yes"  if  there  is an explicit "ToUnicode" map in
              the PDF  file  (the  absence  of  a  ToUnicode  map
              doesn't  necessarily  mean  that  the text can't be
              converted to Unicode)

       object ID
              the font dictionary object ID (number  and  genera-
              tion)

       PDF files can contain the following types of fonts:

              Type 1
              Type 1C -- aka Compact Font Format (CFF)
              Type 1C (OT) -- OpenType with 8-bit CFF data
              Type 3
              TrueType
              TrueType (OT) -- OpenType with 8-bit TrueType data
              CID Type 0 -- 16-bit font with no specified type
              CID Type 0C -- 16-bit PostScript CFF font
              CID Type 0C (OT) -- OpenType with CID CFF data
              CID TrueType -- 16-bit TrueType font
              CID  TrueType  (OT)  --  OpenType with CID TrueType
              data

CONFIGURATION FILE
       Pdffonts reads a configuration file at startup.  It  first
       tries  to  find the user's private config file, ~/.xpdfrc.
       If that doesn't exist, it looks for a  system-wide  config
       file,  typically  /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc (but this location
       can be changed when pdffonts is built).  See the xpdfrc(5)
       man page for details.

OPTIONS
       Many  of  the following options can be set with configura-
       tion file commands.  These are listed in  square  brackets
       with  the  description  of  the corresponding command line
       option.

       -f number
              Specifies the first page to analyze.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to analyze.

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.   Pro-
              viding  this will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -cfg config-file
              Read config-file in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the  sys-
              tem-wide config file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print  usage  information.   (-help  and --help are
              equivalent.)

EXIT CODES
       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.
