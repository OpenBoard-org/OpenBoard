2 NCLUDE_FILE

       xpdfrc - configuration file for Xpdf tools (version 3.02)

       include config-file
              Includes  the specified config file.  The effect of
              this is equivalent to  inserting  the  contents  of
              config-file directly into the parent config file in
              place of the include command.  Config files can  be
              nested arbitrarily deeply.

                                                               ()

2 HARACTER_MAPPIN

       nameToUnicode map-file
              Specifies  a  file  with the mapping from character
              names to Unicode.  This is used to handle PDF fonts
              that  have  valid encodings but no ToUnicode entry.
              Each line of a nameToUnicode file looks like this:

                   hex-string name

              The hex-string is  the  Unicode  (UCS-2)  character
              index,  and  name  is  the  corresponding character
              name.  Multiple nameToUnicode files can be used; if
              a  character name is given more than once, the code
              in the last specified file is  used.   There  is  a
              built-in  default  nameToUnicode  table with all of
              Adobe's standard character names.

       cidToUnicode registry-ordering map-file
              Specifies the file with the mapping from  character
              collection to Unicode.  Each line of a cidToUnicode
              file represents one character:

                   hex-string

              The hex-string is the  Unicode  (UCS-2)  index  for
              that  character.   The  first  line maps CID 0, the
              second line CID 1, etc.  File size is determined by
              size of the character collection.  Only one file is
              allowed per character collection; the  last  speci-
              fied file is used.  There are no built-in cidToUni-
              code mappings.

       unicodeToUnicode font-name-substring map-file
              This is used to work around PDF  fonts  which  have
              incorrect Unicode information.  It specifies a file
              which  maps  from  the  given  (incorrect)  Unicode
              indexes  to  the correct ones.  The mapping will be
              used   for   any   font   whose    name    contains
              font-name-substring.   Each line of a unicodeToUni-
              code file represents one Unicode character:

                  in-hex out-hex1 out-hex2 ...

              The in-hex field is an  input  (incorrect)  Unicode
              index,  and  the rest of the fields are one or more
              output (correct) Unicode indexes.  Each  occurrence
              of in-hex will be converted to the specified output
              sequence.

       unicodeMap encoding-name map-file
              Specifies the file with  mapping  from  Unicode  to
              encoding-name.  These encodings are used for X dis-
              play fonts and text output (see below).  Each  line
              of  a  unicodeMap file represents a range of one or
              more Unicode characters which maps  linearly  to  a
              range in the output encoding:

                   in-start-hex in-end-hex out-start-hex

              Entries  for  single  characters can be abbreviated
              to:

                   in-hex out-hex

              The in-start-hex and in-end-hex fields (or the sin-
              gle  in-hex  field) specify the Unicode range.  The
              out-start-hex field (or the out-hex  field)  speci-
              fies  the  start of the output encoding range.  The
              length of the  out-start-hex  (or  out-hex)  string
              determines  the  length  of  the  output characters
              (e.g., UTF-8 uses different  numbers  of  bytes  to
              represent characters in different ranges).  Entries
              must be given in increasing  Unicode  order.   Only
              one  file  is allowed per encoding; the last speci-
              fied file is used.   The  Latin1,  ASCII7,  Symbol,
              ZapfDingbats, UTF-8, and UCS-2 encodings are prede-
              fined.

       cMapDir registry-ordering dir
              Specifies a search directory, dir,  for  CMaps  for
              the  registry-ordering character collection.  There
              can be multiple directories for a  particular  col-
              lection.  There are no default CMap directories.

       toUnicodeDir dir
              Specifies  a  search  directory, dir, for ToUnicode
              CMaps.  There can be  multiple  ToUnicode  directo-
              ries.   There are no default ToUnicode directories.

2 ISPLAY_FONT

       displayFontT1 PDF-font-name T1-file
              Maps  a  PDF  font, PDF-font-name, to a Type 1 font
              for display.  The Type 1 font file, T1-file, should
              be a standard .pfa or .pfb file.

       displayFontTT PDF-font-name TT-file
              Maps  a PDF font, PDF-font-name, to a TrueType font
              for display.   The  TrueType  font  file,  TT-file,
              should be a standard .ttf file.

       displayNamedCIDFontT1 PDF-font-name T1-file
              Maps    a   specific   PDF   CID   (16-bit)   font,
              PDF-font-name, to a  CID  font  (16-bit  PostScript
              font),  for display.  There are no default CID font
              mappings.

       displayCIDFontT1 registry-ordering T1-file
              Maps the registry-ordering character collection  to
              a  CID  font (16-bit PostScript font), for display.
              This mapping is used if the font name doesn't match
              any of the fonts declared with displayNamedCIDFont*
              commands.  There are no default CID font  mappings.

       displayNamedCIDFontTT PDF-font-name TT-file
              Maps    a   specific   PDF   CID   (16-bit)   font,
              PDF-font-name, to a  (16-bit)  TrueType  font,  for
              display.  There are no default CID font mappings.

       displayCIDFontTT registry-ordering TT-file
              Maps  the registry-ordering character collection to
              a (16-bit) TrueType font, for display.   This  map-
              ping  is used if the font name doesn't match any of
              the fonts declared with  displayNamedCIDFont*  com-
              mands.  There are no default CID font mappings.

       fontDir dir
              Specifies  a  search  directory  for  external font
              files.  There can be multiple fontDir  directories.
              If  a  PDF  file  uses a font but doesn't embed it,
              these directories will be searched for  a  matching
              font  file.  These fonts are used by both xpdf (for
              display) and pdftops (for embedding in  the  gener-
              ated  PostScript).  Type 1 fonts must have a suffix
              of ".pfa", ".pfb", ".ps",  or  no  suffix  at  all.
              TrueType  fonts  must  have a ".ttf" suffix.  Other
              files in these directories will be ignored.   There
              are no default fontDir directories.

                                                               ()

2 OSTSCRIPT_CONTRO

       psPaperSize width(pts) height(pts)
              Sets  the  paper  size  for PostScript output.  The
              width and height parameters give the paper size  in
              PostScript points (1 point = 1/72 inch).

       psPaperSize letter | legal | A4 | A3 | match
              Sets  the  paper  size  for  PostScript output to a
              standard size.  The default paper size is set  when
              xpdf  and  pdftops are built, typically to "letter"
              or "A4".  This can also be set  to  "match",  which
              will set the paper size to match the size specified
              in the PDF file.

       psImageableArea llx lly urx ury
              Sets the imageable area for PostScript output.  The
              four integers are the coordinates of the lower-left
              and upper-right corners of  the  imageable  region,
              specified  in  points  (with  the  origin being the
              lower-left corner of the paper).  This defaults  to
              the  full  paper  size; the psPaperSize option will
              reset the imageable area coordinates.

       psCrop yes | no
              If set to "yes", PostScript output  is  cropped  to
              the CropBox specified in the PDF file; otherwise no
              cropping is done.  This defaults to "yes".

       psExpandSmaller yes | no
              If  set  to  "yes",  PDF  pages  smaller  than  the
              PostScript  imageable area are expanded to fill the
              imageable area.  Otherwise, no scalling is done  on
              smaller pages.  This defaults to "no".

       psShrinkLarger yes | no
              If set to yes, PDF pages larger than the PostScript
              imageable area are  shrunk  to  fit  the  imageable
              area.   Otherwise,  no  scaling  is  done on larger
              pages.  This defaults to "yes".

       psCenter yes | no
              If  set  to  yes,  PDF  pages  smaller   than   the
              PostScript  imageable  area (after any scaling) are
              centered in the imageable  area.   Otherwise,  they
              are  aligned at the lower-left corner of the image-
              able area.  This defaults to "yes".

       psDuplex yes | no
              If set to "yes", the generated PostScript will  set
              the  "Duplex" pagedevice entry.  This tells duplex-
              capable  printers  to   enable   duplexing.    This
              defaults to "no".

       psLevel level1 | level1sep | level2 | level2sep | level3 |
       level3Sep
              Sets   the  PostScript  level  to  generate.   This
              defaults to "level2".

       psFont PDF-font-name PS-font-name
              When the PDF-font-name font is used in a PDF  file,
              it  will  be  translated  to  the  PostScript  font
              PS-font-name, which is assumed to  be  resident  in
              the    printer.    Typically,   PDF-font-name   and
              PS-font-name are the same.  By  default,  only  the
              Base-14 fonts are assumed to be resident.

       psNamedFont16 PDF-font-name wMode PS-font-name encoding
              When the 16-bit font PDF-font-name is used in a PDF
              file with the wMode writing mode and is not  embed-
              ded,  the  PS-font-name font is substituted for it.
              The writing mode must be either 'H' for  horizontal
              or  'V'  for  vertical.   The  PS-font-name font is
              assumed to be resident in the printer  and  to  use
              the   specified  encoding  (which  must  have  been
              defined with the unicodeMap command).

       psFont16 registry-ordering wMode PS-font-name encoding
              When a  16-bit  font  using  the  registry-ordering
              character  collection and wMode writing mode is not
              embedded and  does  not  match  any  of  the  fonts
              declared    in    psNamedFont16    commands,    the
              PS-font-name font is substituted for it.  The writ-
              ing  mode  must be either 'H' for horizontal or 'V'
              for vertical.  The PS-font-name font is assumed  to
              be resident in the printer and to use the specified
              writing mode and encoding  (which  must  have  been
              defined with the unicodeMap command).

       psEmbedType1Fonts yes | no
              If  set to "no", prevents embedding of Type 1 fonts
              in generated PostScript.  This defaults to "yes".

       psEmbedTrueTypeFonts yes | no
              If set to  "no",  prevents  embedding  of  TrueType
              fonts  in  generated  PostScript.  This defaults to
              "yes".

       psEmbedCIDTrueTypeFonts yes | no
              If set to "no", prevents embedding of CID  TrueType
              fonts   in   generated  PostScript.   For  Level  3
              PostScript, this generates a CID  font,  for  lower
              levels it generates a non-CID composite font.

       psEmbedCIDPostScriptFonts yes | no
              If   set   to   "no",  prevents  embedding  of  CID
              PostScript  fonts  in  generated  PostScript.   For
              Level  3 PostScript, this generates a CID font, for
              lower levels it generates a non-CID composite font.

       psPreload yes | no
              If set to "yes", PDF forms are converted to PS pro-
              cedures, and image data is  preloaded.   This  uses
              more memory in the PostScript interpreter, but gen-
              erates significantly smaller PS files in situations
              where,  e.g., the same image is drawn on every page
              of a long document.  This defaults to "no".

       psOPI yes | no
              If set to "yes", generates PostScript OPI  comments
              for  all  images  and forms which have OPI informa-
              tion.  This option is only available  if  the  Xpdf
              tools   were   compiled  with  OPI  support.   This
              defaults to "no".

       psASCIIHex yes | no
              If set to "yes", the ASCIIHexEncode filter will  be
              used  instead  of  ASCII85Encode  for  binary data.
              This defaults to "no".

       psFile file-or-command
              Sets the default PostScript file or  print  command
              for  xpdf.   Commands  start  with a '|' character;
              anything else is a file.  If the file name or  com-
              mand  contains  spaces  it  must  be  quoted.  This
              defaults to unset, which tells xpdf to  generate  a
              name   of   the  form  <file>.ps  for  a  PDF  file
              <file>.pdf.

       fontDir dir
              See the description above,  in  the  DISPLAY  FONTS
              section.

                                                               ()

2 EXT_CONTRO

       textEncoding encoding-name
              Sets  the  encoding  to use for text output.  (This
              can be overridden with the  "-enc"  switch  on  the
              command  line.)   The encoding-name must be defined
              with the  unicodeMap  command  (see  above).   This
              defaults to "Latin1".

       textEOL unix | dos | mac
              Sets  the  end-of-line  convention  to use for text
              output.  The options are:

                  unix = LF
                  dos  = CR+LF
                  mac  = CR

              (This can be overridden with the "-eol"  switch  on
              the  command  line.)  The default value is based on
              the OS where xpdf and pdftotext were built.

       textPageBreaks yes | no
              If set to "yes", text extraction will  insert  page
              breaks  (form feed characters) between pages.  This
              defaults to "yes".

       textKeepTinyChars yes | no
              If set to "yes",  text  extraction  will  keep  all
              characters.   If  set to "no", text extraction will
              discard tiny  (smaller  than  3  point)  characters
              after  the first 50000 per page, avoiding extremely
              slow run times for PDF files that use special fonts
              to  do shading or cross-hatching.  This defaults to
              "no".

                                                               ()

2 ISCELLANEOUS_SETTING

       initialZoom percentage | page | width
              Sets the initial zoom factor.  A number specifies a
              zoom percentage, where 100 means 72 dpi.   You  may
              also  specify 'page', to fit the page to the window
              size, or 'width', to fit the page width to the win-
              dow width.

       continuousView yes | no
              If set to "yes", xpdf will start in continuous view
              mode, i.e., with one vertical screoll bar  for  the
              whole document.  This defaults to "no".

       enableT1lib yes | no
              Enables  or  disables  use  of t1lib (a Type 1 font
              rasterizer).  This is only  relevant  if  the  Xpdf
              tools    were    built    with    t1lib    support.
              ("enableT1lib"  replaces  the  old   "t1libControl"
              option.)  This option defaults to "yes".

       enableFreeType yes | no
              Enables  or  disables use of FreeType (a TrueType /
              Type 1 font rasterizer).  This is only relevant  if
              the  Xpdf  tools  were built with FreeType support.
              ("enableFreeType" replaces  the  old  "freetypeCon-
              trol" option.)  This option defaults to "yes".

       antialias yes | no
              Enables  or  disables font anti-aliasing in the PDF
              rasterizer.  This option affects all font rasteriz-
              ers.   ("antialias" replaces the anti-aliasing con-
              trol  provided  by  the  old   "t1libControl"   and
              "freetypeControl" options.)  This default to "yes".

       vectorAntialias yes | no
              Enables or disables anti-aliasing of vector  graph-
              ics in the PDF rasterizer.  This defaults to "yes".

       strokeAdjust yes | no
              Enables  or  disables  stroke   adjustment.    This
              defaults to "yes".

       screenType dispersed | clustered | stochasticClustered
              Sets  the  halftone screen type, which will be used
              when generating a monochrome (1-bit)  bitmap.   The
              three  options  are  dispersed-dot dithering, clus-
              tered-dot dithering (with a round dot and 45-degree
              screen angle), and stochastic clustered-dot dither-
              ing.  By default, "stochasticClustered" is used for
              resolutions  of 300 dpi and higher, and "dispersed"
              is used for resolutions lower then 300 dpi.

       screenSize integer
              Sets the  size  of  the  (square)  halftone  screen
              threshold  matrix.   By default, this is 4 for dis-
              persed-dot dithering, 10 for clustered-dot  dither-
              ing,  and  100 for stochastic clustered-dot dither-
              ing.

       screenDotRadius integer
              Sets the halftone screen dot radius.  This is  only
              used when screenType is set to stochasticClustered,
              and it defaults to 2.  In clustered-dot  mode,  the
              dot  radius is half of the screen size.  Dispersed-
              dot dithering doesn't have a dot radius.

       screenGamma float
              Sets the halftone screen gamma  correction  parame-
              ter.   Gamma  values greater than 1 make the output
              brighter; gamma values less than 1 make it  darker.
              The default value is 1.

       screenBlackThreshold float
              When  halftoning,  all  values below this threshold
              are forced to solid black.   This  parameter  is  a
              floating  point  value  between  0  (black)  and  1
              (white).  The default value is 0.

       screenWhiteThreshold float
              When halftoning, all values  above  this  threshold
              are  forced  to  solid  white.  This parameter is a
              floating  point  value  between  0  (black)  and  1
              (white).  The default value is 1.

       urlCommand command
              Sets  the  command executed when you click on a URL
              link.  The string "%s" will be  replaced  with  the
              URL.  (See the example below.)  This has no default
              value.

       movieCommand command
              Sets the command executed when you click on a movie
              annotation.   The string "%s" will be replaced with
              the movie file name.  This has no default value.

       mapNumericCharNames yes | no
              If set to "yes", the Xpdf tools will attempt to map
              various  numeric  character names sometimes used in
              font subsets.  In some cases this leads  to  usable
              text,  and  in other cases it leads to gibberish --
              there is no way for Xpdf to tell.  This defaults to
              "yes".

       mapUnknownCharNames yes | no
              If  set to "yes", and mapNumericCharNames is set to
              "no", the Xpdf tools  will  apply  a  simple  pass-
              through  mapping  (Unicode  index = character code)
              for all unrecognized glyph names.  In  some  cases,
              this  leads  to  usable text, and in other cases it
              leads to gibberish -- there is no way for  Xpdf  to
              tell.  This defaults to "no".

       bind modifiers-key context command ...
              Add  a  key or mouse button binding.  Modifiers can
              be zero or more of:

                  shift-
                  ctrl-
                  alt-

              Key can be a regular ASCII character,  or  any  one
              of:

                  space
                  tab
                  return
                  enter
                  backspace
                  insert
                  delete
                  home
                  end
                  pgup
                  pgdn
                  left / right / up / down        (arrow keys)
                  f1 .. f35                       (function keys)
                  mousePress1 .. mousePress7      (mouse buttons)
                  mouseRelease1 .. mouseRelease7  (mouse buttons)

              Context is either "any" or a comma-separated combi-
              nation of:

                  fullScreen / window       (full screen mode on/off)
                  continuous / singlePage   (continuous mode on/off)
                  overLink / offLink        (mouse over link or not)
                  scrLockOn / scrLockOff    (scroll lock on/off)

              The context string can include  only  one  of  each
              pair in the above list.

              Command  is  an Xpdf command (see the COMMANDS sec-
              tion of the xpdf(1) man page for details).   Multi-
              ple commands are separated by whitespace.

              The bind command replaces any existing binding, but
              only if it was defined for  the  exact  same  modi-
              fiers,  key,  and  context.  All tokens (modifiers,
              key, context, commands) are case-sensitive.

              Example key bindings:

                  # bind ctrl-a in any context to the nextPage
                  # command
                  bind ctrl-a any nextPage

                  # bind uppercase B, when in continuous mode
                  # with scroll lock on, to the reload command
                  # followed by the prevPage command
                  bind B continuous,scrLockOn reload prevPage

              See the xpdf(1) man page for more examples.

       unbind modifiers-key context
              Removes a key binding  established  with  the  bind
              command.  This is most useful to remove default key
              bindings before establishing new ones (e.g., if the
              default key binding is given for "any" context, and
              you want to create new key  bindings  for  multiple
              contexts).

       printCommands yes | no
              If  set  to  "yes", drawing commands are printed as
              they're  executed  (useful  for  debugging).   This
              defaults to "no".

       errQuiet yes | no
              If  set  to  "yes",  this  suppresses all error and
              warning messages from all of the Xpdf tools.   This
              defaults to "no".

                                                               ()
